Model Comparison – Ridge vs Random Forest



Models Trained

\- Ridge Regression

\- Random Forest Regressor



Evaluation Metrics

\- MAE

\- RMSE



Observations

\- Random Forest captures non-linear demand patterns

\- Feature importance highlights recent demand as the strongest predictor

\- Random Forest generally outperforms the linear baseline



Conclusion

Random Forest is selected as a stronger candidate model

for pharmaceutical demand forecasting.



XGBoost Results



\- XGBoost achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE among all models

\- Boosting helps capture complex demand patterns

\- Selected as the primary forecasting model
